                <h1>What is Data science</h1>
                <small>April,2021</small>
                <p class="blog" style="font-weight: 210;"> 
                    According to me in 2 words it's research in the data.

                     The data scientist has to find valuable information from the raw data not only that. The main thing it involves developing methods.  
                     If I am talking about me that when I came to know about Data science it's really interesting. actually I was using my Facebook at that time I saw a video on Facebook about Cambridge Analytica

                     maybe you all know about the story behind it. if you don't know then I want to tell you in 3 to 4 lines what happened......

                     Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm that did work for the Trump campaign okay Cambridge Analytica and Facebook are tied together how, when I don't know but what I know it is facebook gives 87 million Facebook Profile data of the US people to the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm and what's the interesting thing it is Cambridge Analytica hire a data scientist team( "I assume I don't know exactly what happened") who work for them and what those data scientist and software developer team did, they made a software and the name is Kogan which is quiz app and they put question regarding something political to know about people psychology to itself and other political parties after to know about what they people thought they showed a particular video, advertise, post to target audience to manipulate them. because C.A political partie have the data of them and they win in very bulk votes.

                     How is easy it to win with the help of data?

                     Here I came to know the power of Data, what we can do with the help of it. 

                     What impact is going to create in the upcoming future?

                     As we can see Over 2.5 quintillion bytes data generated in a day and there are lot sources from its generated. even IoT devices are continuously generating the data every time.

                     IN today's world people tell data to gold just assume after 10 to 20 years what those people will tell about it .when it is in the huge amount as compared to today.
